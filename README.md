# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Instructions

To run this, simply open the `index.html` in your browser of the latest version. The application will be shown and Jasmine will run the unit tests for you. It will test for:

* if the menu functions correctly (it should open and close)
* if the js returns any data at all
* if the returned data has the correct format
* if the returned data is printed on the page
* if after loading new data, it replaces the old data printed before

## Dependencies

This project is dependent on functionality of Jasmine, which is included in this repository.

## Contribute

There is no need to contribute to this, as it is a finished assignment and project.
